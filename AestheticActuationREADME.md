``` ~ = collapse all ```

``` 1 = expand only actuation design ```

``` 2 = time signal design ```

``` 3 = composition design ```
``` l = toggle "live" option ```

Load artowrk through drop-down on left
Connect to peripheral w/ drop-down on right (hit "connect" button to right of drop-down")
Far-right button determines whether it sends things live 


# Server to talk to Arduino
Open TCP server to talk w/ arduino. 
```
$ cd rails-iot/ruby_scripts
// This is the file: rails-iot/ruby_scripts/ArduinoServer.rb
$ ruby ArduinoServer.rb
```

# using app
create a group: either drag line, or pull from actuator segment up to group segment
name group: "myblock" 

note for user study: explin hue, saturation, and brightness
can save groups, green led shows save

add to a group: select the new ones, put them both in the "bin", hit "G" to group them together (now save, 

# signal design world
trash-can in upper-right-hand empties basket.
drag from library to cut to chop it off. X chops it.
weld: mage on left is "current" images on right are pieces that get composed
forge: 

eye toggle shows hue instead of intensity
specify to send to the hue channel (be sure to turn on brightness, and turn up saturation to see it)

# composition world
drag from saved
can drag a thing from library to a certain channel
spacebar plays and pauses

# async number
sometimes the system gets overwhelmed w/ lots of commands.
drag down from async section to update
would be nice to define ordering

# weird bugs

# user study notes
go through all the tasks
make "pay attention to me"
"go this way"
enter user id at top for logging
show them how to weld stuff
hopes: the mental operations like welding forging, etc result in new vocabulary to explore different signals.

psychophysics: hot key to send "perceptual signal" vs "our version"
